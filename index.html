<h1>The introduction</h1>

<p>We are working on an NES-inspired platformer in Java 1.6 and libGDX. Currently developed in OSX and testing in Windows and Android mobile phones as well.</p>

<h1>The Story</h1>

<p>The game is very sarcastic and humorous. It starts out with the main character pouring batter into bowl in kitchen (there will be art-boards in the intro scenes). In the next screen he exclaims "Shiat, out of milk!" while rushing out of door -- fridge open in background. Then it shows the character running towards town in the distance. This is the entire premise of the game. When the player arrives in town, he'll learn that although most of the town is accessible, the grocery is not accessible due to a bridge being out. The game will consist of the player obtaining parts to fix the bridge so that he can get his milk and finally make his waffles!</p>

<h1>The Gameplay</h1>

<p>The town will consist of buildings (much like the towns you are familiar with). Each building is actually a "world" and will be quite large and have many inside, underground, and outside areas. Each "world" will have a list of "tasks" to complete -- which you will see when standing near the house's door. Completing all tasks will unlock the final task for that world, which will net you the piece of bridge you are looking for. Initially one house is accessible, but the next house becomes accessible as soon as the first task of the previous house is completed. The player will not be able to linearly complete all tasks at each world due to need of items or skills found in other worlds; so the player has to experiment and think about what paths his newly obtained loot will open up. Gameplay style is of course platformed style, with a bit of RPG mixed in (no leveling or EXP, but there will be projectile and melee fighting). There is also physics (Box2D), but the physics is downplayed and no puzzles will explicitly rely on physics (as I personally hate those types of games). I'm hoping to have at least 15 hours of gameplay (meaning 15 hours to complete if you know what you are doing) so this isn't something that I'll have finished next month of course.</p>

<h1>The Rest</h1>

<p>Ff there is a linux or windows guy out there who's a night owl and wants to help test and provide feedback that'd be great.</p>
